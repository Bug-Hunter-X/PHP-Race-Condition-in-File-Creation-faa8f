This corrected code uses `flock` to acquire an exclusive lock on the file before creating it.  This prevents the race condition.

```php
<?php
$file = fopen('my_file.txt', 'w');
if ($file) {
if (flock($file, LOCK_EX)) { // Acquire an exclusive lock
    //Check if file exists again to avoid unnecessary write if file was created by another process
    if(!file_exists('my_file.txt')){
        fwrite($file, 'Some data');
    }
    flock($file, LOCK_UN); // Release the lock
}
fclose($file);
}
?>
```
