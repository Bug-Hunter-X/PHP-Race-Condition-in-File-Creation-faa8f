This code suffers from a potential race condition.  If two requests come in simultaneously, they might both check if the file exists, find that it doesn't, and then both proceed to create it.  This leads to only one file being created, while the other request thinks it created the file, leading to data loss or inconsistency.

```php
<?php
if (!file_exists('my_file.txt')) {
    $file = fopen('my_file.txt', 'w');
    fwrite($file, 'Some data');
    fclose($file);
}
?>
```
